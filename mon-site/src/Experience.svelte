    <p style="margin: 0;">I had the chance to realize my first intership at ANITI <br/>
    I have worked on the development of a position estimation algorithm (PnP) in Numpy and Pytorch for optimising the learning function of YOLO-NAS for vision-based landing. 
    The objective was to estimate the positon of the airplaine from the image they have, in order to take in consideration that the model can do more errors, if the plane is far away from the runway <br/>

    <p> In order to implement this algorithm I'v also work on a Differentiable Root Solvers for Cubic and Quartic Polynomials :   <a href="https://github.com/Pruneeuh/AutoRoot" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> AutoRoot </a>
